For example, it was found in Minecraft servers which allowed the commands to be typed into chat logs as these were then sent to the logger. This makes it a very serious vulnerability, as the logging library is used so widely and it may be simple to exploit. Many open source maintainers are working hard with fixes and updates to the software ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The vulnerable versions of Log4j 2 are versions 2.0 to version 2.14.1 inclusive. The first fixed version is 2.15.0. We strongly encourage you to update to the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/download.html\" rel=\"noopener\">latest version</a> if you can. If you are using a version before 2.0, you are also not vulnerable.</p>\n<p>You may not be vulnerable if you are using these versions, as your configuration\nmay already mitigate this, or the things you\nlog may not include any user input.
